Upgrading Grape
===============

### Upgrading to >= 0.9.1

#### Changes to content-types

The following content-types have been removed:

* atom (application/atom+xml)
* rss (application/rss+xml)
* jsonapi (application/jsonapi)

This is because they have never been properly supported.

### Upgrading to >= 0.9.0 

#### Changes in Authentication

The following middleware classes have been removed:

* `Grape::Middleware::Auth::Basic` 
* `Grape::Middleware::Auth::Digest`
* `Grape::Middleware::Auth::OAuth2`

When you use theses classes directly like:

```ruby
 module API
   class Root < Grape::API
     class Protected < Grape::API
       use Grape::Middleware::Auth::OAuth2,
           token_class: 'AccessToken',
           parameter: %w(access_token api_key)
           
```

you have to replace these classes.

As replacement can be used

* `Grape::Middleware::Auth::Basic`  => [`Rack::Auth::Basic`](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/auth/basic.rb)
* `Grape::Middleware::Auth::Digest` => [`Rack::Auth::Digest::MD5`](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/auth/digest/md5.rb)
* `Grape::Middleware::Auth::OAuth2` => [warden-oauth2](https://github.com/opperator/warden-oauth2) or [rack-oauth2](https://github.com/nov/rack-oauth2)

If this is not possible you can extract the middleware files from [grape v0.7.0](https://github.com/intridea/grape/tree/v0.7.0/lib/grape/middleware/auth)
and host these files within your application

See [#703](https://github.com/intridea/Grape/pull/703) for more information.

### Upgrading to >= 0.7.0

#### Changes in Exception Handling

Assume you have the following exception classes defined.

```ruby
class ParentError < StandardError; end
class ChildError < ParentError; end
```

In Grape <= 0.6.1, the `rescue_from` keyword only handled the exact exception being raised. The following code would rescue `ParentError`, but not `ChildError`.

```ruby
rescue_from ParentError do |e|
  # only rescue ParentError
end
```

This made it impossible to rescue an exception hieararchy, which is a more sensible default. In Grape 0.7.0 or newer, both `ParentError` and `ChildError` are rescued.

```ruby
rescue_from ParentError do |e|
  # rescue both ParentError and ChildError
end
```

To only rescue the base exception class, set `rescue_subclasses: false`.

```ruby
rescue_from ParentError, rescue_subclasses: false do |e|
  # only rescue ParentError
end
```

See [#544](https://github.com/intridea/grape/pull/544) for more information.


#### Changes in the Default HTTP Status Code

In Grape <= 0.6.1, the default status code returned from `error!` was 403.

```ruby
error! "You may not reticulate this spline!" # yields HTTP error 403
```

This was a bad default value, since 403 means "Forbidden". Change any call to `error!` that does not specify a status code to specify one. The new default value is a more sensible default of 500, which is "Internal Server Error".

```ruby
error! "You may not reticulate this spline!", 403 # yields HTTP error 403
```

You may also use `default_error_status` to change the global default.

```ruby
default_error_status 400
```

See [#525](https://github.com/intridea/Grape/pull/525) for more information.


#### Changes in Parameter Declaration and Validation

In Grape <= 0.6.1, `group`, `optional` and `requires` keywords with a block accepted either an `Array` or a `Hash`.

```ruby
params do
  requires :id, type: Integer
  group :name do
    requires :first_name
    requires :last_name
  end
end
```

This caused the ambiguity and unexpected errors described in [#543](https://github.com/intridea/Grape/issues/543).

In Grape 0.7.0, the `group`, `optional` and `requires` keywords take an additional `type` attribute which defaults to `Array`. This means that without a `type` attribute, these nested parameters will no longer accept a single hash, only an array (of hashes).

Whereas in 0.6.1 the API above accepted the following json, it no longer does in 0.7.0.

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name" : "Doe"
  }
}
```

The `params` block should now read as follows.

```ruby
params do
  requires :id, type: Integer
  requires :name, type: Hash do
    requires :first_name
    requires :last_name
  end
end
```

See [#545](https://github.com/intridea/Grape/pull/545) for more information.


### Upgrading to 0.6.0

In Grape <= 0.5.0, only the first validation error was raised and processing aborted. Validation errors are now collected and a single `Grape::Exceptions::ValidationErrors` exception is raised. You can access the collection of validation errors as `.errors`.

```ruby
rescue_from Grape::Exceptions::Validations do |e|
  Rack::Response.new({
    status: 422,
    message: e.message,
    errors: e.errors
  }.to_json, 422)
end
```
